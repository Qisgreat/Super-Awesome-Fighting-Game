# Super-Awesome-Fighting-Game

This is one of my first major coding projects. I made for AP Computer Science my Junior year and after tons of work, it 
won best in class. Sadly it requires eclipse to even run (this was before I knew about running things on terminal.

## What it Uses

As you can see by the github tag it is all Java. It uses the light wieght java game library (lwjgl). 

Also the animations are all custom made by me.

**Hope you like it. It brings me back to a simpler time**
